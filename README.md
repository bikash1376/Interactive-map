- 🔍 Zoom and pan functionality for exploring complex maps
- 📱 Mobile-friendly design with touch support
- 🔄 Expandable nodes to dive deeper into subtopics

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js, React, TypeScript
- **UI**: Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI
- **Visualization**: React Flow
- **AI**: Google Gemini API
- **Layout**: Dagre for automatic graph layout

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm/yarn
- Google Gemini API key

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bikash1376/Interactive-map
   cd interactive-map
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your Google Gemini API key:
   ```
   GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

4. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   pnpm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```

5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## API Usage

The application uses Google's Gemini AI to generate learning maps. The API is called through Next.js API routes.

### API Endpoints

- `POST /api/generate-map` - Generates a learning map for a given topic
  - Request body: `{ "topic": "Your topic here" }`
  - Response: JSON object containing nodes and edges for the learning map

- `GET /api/health` - Health check endpoint
  - Response: `{ "message": "✅API is fine" }`

### Environment Variables

- `GOOGLE_API_KEY`: Your Google Gemini API key (required)

## How It Works

1. **Map Generation**: When you enter a topic, the app sends a request to the Gemini API with a carefully crafted prompt to generate a structured learning path.

2. **Data Processing**: The response is processed to create nodes (learning topics) and edges (connections between topics).

3. **Visualization**: The learning map is rendered using React Flow, with automatic layout handled by the Dagre library.

4. **Interaction**: Users can:
   - Pan and zoom the map
   - Click on nodes to see details
   - Expand nodes to explore subtopics
   - Toggle between light and dark mode
